    <h2>The Master of Variety</h2>

    <p>The story of Ed Sullivan is one of a man whose on-camera persona was that of a stone-faced, humorless emcee. However, his off-screen life was full of glamour, great career heights, and the personal satisfaction of being famous. He tried to make a name in the movies, loved the New York nightlife, and was an avid world traveler. Ed led the life of an eccentric celebrity living in the Delmonico Hotel, out all night and eating pork chops for a late breakfast. But Ed’s ultimate claim to fame was that he hosted the longest-running primetime variety show in the history of television. <br><br> Edward Vincent Sullivan began his professional career as a newspaper reporter, covering sports for a variety of papers until 1931. Then his career took a major turn when he wrote a feature about Broadway, prompting The New York Daily News to hire him to write a regular column, “Little Ole New York,” on all aspects of the city. From 1932 until his death, a Sullivan column remained a popular fixture in the N.Y. newspaper world. Beginning in the late 1920s, Sullivan added another dimension to his working life when he began hosting radio programs with Broadway themes. By the 1940s, while hosting “Ed Sullivan Presents” from the 21 Club, Ed began to accept offers to emcee reviews at theaters in Manhattan which led to him hosting additional events. He was now on his way to achieving what he had always wanted – fame. <br><br> In 1947, Sullivan emceed the Harvest Moon Ball for The New York Daily News and, unbeknownst to him, the affair was televised (very few people had TV’s then). CBS subsequently hired Sullivan to host their new variety show, “Toast of the Town,” which debuted on June 20, 1948. It was rough going in the beginning with sponsors threatening to pull their advertising dollars unless CBS replaced Ed. Ed was a fighter and battled hard to book the best talent he could and William Paley, the head of CBS stood behind him. Ed loved to stand in the spotlight on center stage. He had found his métier. Despite fighting his numerous critics and Ed’s show eventually took hold and became a major rating success, prompting the network to announce Ed Sullivan as the host at the beginning of each show. In 1955 the show was re-named “The Ed Sullivan Show” and has continued to air on CBS Sunday nights at 8 pm.</p>
